<h1 style="color:pink;">We are planning to make a web application, which finds and store the user’s travel history, 
into its database, whenever he/she is out in the public transports and at the end of the day the person will be able to know</h1>

·  <h2 style="color:green;">From which places he/she has travelled in the day and how many of them were hotspots.</h2>

·  <h2 style="color:green;">What is the probability of getting COVID-19 (low , mid , high , very high) calculated by his/her travel history and the places where the person has travelled.</h2>

·  <h2 style="color:green;">Details of the public transport routes so that he/she can know what are the risks of travelling in that transport.</h2>
