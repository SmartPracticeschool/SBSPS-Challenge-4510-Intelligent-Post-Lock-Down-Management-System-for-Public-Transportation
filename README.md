# SBSPS-Challenge-4510-Intelligent-Post-Lock-Down-Management-System-for-Public-Transportation

We are planning to make a web application, which finds and store the user’s travel history, 
into its database, whenever he/she is out in the public transports and at the end of the day the person will be able to know

·  From which places he/she has travelled in the day and how many of them were hotspots.

·  What is the probability of getting COVID-19 (low , mid , high , very high) calculated by his/her travel history and the places where the person has travelled.

·  Details of the public transport routes so that he/she can know what are the risks of travelling in that transport.
